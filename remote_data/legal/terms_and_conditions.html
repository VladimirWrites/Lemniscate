<strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
    By downloading or using the app, these terms will
    automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
    that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
    allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
    our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
    extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
    to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
    versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
    database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
    to it, still belong to Vladimir Jovanovic.
</p> <p>
    Vladimir Jovanovic is committed to ensuring that the app is
    as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
    reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
    its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
    charge you for the app or its services without making it very
    clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
</p> <p>
    The Lemniscate app stores and processes personal data that
    you have provided to us, to provide my
    Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
    access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
    not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
    removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
    official operating system of your device. It could make your
    phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
    compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
    that the Lemniscate app won’t work properly or at all.
</p> <!----> <p>
    You should be aware that there are certain things that
    Vladimir Jovanovic will not take responsibility for. Certain
    functions of the app will require the app to have an active
    internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
    by your mobile network provider, but Vladimir Jovanovic
    cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
    functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
    have any of your data allowance left.
</p> <p></p> <p>
    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
    should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
    be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
    the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
    other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
    responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
    charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
    (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
    you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
    using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
    received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
</p> <p>
    Along the same lines, Vladimir Jovanovic cannot always take
    responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
    make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
    battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
    Vladimir Jovanovic cannot accept responsibility.
</p> <p>
    With respect to Vladimir Jovanovic’s responsibility for your
    use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
    bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
    updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
    to provide information to us so that we can make it available
    to you. Vladimir Jovanovic accepts no liability for any
    loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
    relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
</p> <p>
    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
    currently available on Android – the requirements for the
    system(and for any additional systems we
    decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
    and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
    using the app. Vladimir Jovanovic does not promise that it
    will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
    and/or works with the Android version that you have
    installed on your device. However, you promise to always
    accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
    also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
    it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
    Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
    rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
    (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
    from your device.
