<strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
    Vladimir Jovanovic built the Lemniscate app as

    policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
    used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
    anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p> <p>
    The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
    as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
    Lemniscate unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
</p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
    For a better experience, while using our Service, I
    may require you to provide us with certain personally
    identifiable information. The information that
    I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
</p> <!----> <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
    I want to inform you that whenever you
    use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
    I collect data and information (through third-party
    products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
    include information such as your device Internet Protocol
    (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
    configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
    the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
    statistics.
</p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
    commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
    to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
    stored on your device's internal memory.
</p> <p>
    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
    the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
    “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
    You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
    and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
    choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
    portions of this Service.
</p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
    I may employ third-party companies and
    individuals due to the following reasons:
</p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
    I want to inform users of this Service
    that these third parties have access to their Personal
    Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
    them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
    disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
</p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
    I value your trust in providing us your
    Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
    acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
    of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
    storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
    guarantee its absolute security.

    This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
    a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
    that these external sites are not operated by me.
    Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
    Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
    no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
    privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
    services.

    identifiable information from children. I
